        "\n",
        "The goal here is to understand the foundations and mechanics behind LLMs rather than relying on higher-level abstractions or frameworks. You'll see what happens “under the hood”, how an LLM receives a text, processes it, and generate a response. In later projects, you'll use frameworks like Ollama and LangChain that simplify many of these steps. But before that, this project will help you build a solid mental model of how LLMs actually work.\n",
